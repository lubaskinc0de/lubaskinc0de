### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Hm, i dont sure what i should write. But, im tell some about us. Im most a backend develop, but i love write frontend apps on the React. I work with two of backend frameworks, Django - a good choice for MVP enterprise project, FastAPI - oh, this an awesome framework. On FastAPI i like to implement the "clean-architecture" and fast async web-apps with only API. If i need the only-api in Django, i can work with Django-Rest-Framework. My choice in the database - its a PostgreSQL, i really love it. I wrap my every project in the Docker container? Why? Its a very good for development and run OS-specific tools (like Celery on windows) In the frontend - i really like clean React. In the UI - my choice is Material-UI (https://mui.com). really good ui. i like frontend. And, i can and like to write some telegram stuff, like bots. thanks to aiogram and aiogram-dialog as ui.
